          <h3>CGM Emission</h3>
          <section>
            <div class="row">
              <p>
                The aim of this project was to identify the most promising
                visible/ultraviolet spectral lines with which to observe the
                circumgalactic medium (CGM). Utilizing the spectral synthesis
                code, Cloudy (cite), along with the atomic database Chianti,
                (cite), I was able to create this table that contains the
                various values needed to calculate the intensity in a given
                spectral line. This table serves as both a listing of lines we
                studied in this project and a database to help inform future CGM
                emission studies.

              <p>
                With this data, I was able to test different conditions by
                assuming various density scaling (isobaric vs isochoric) and gas
                physics (mixing vs cooling). This provided 4 models to test the
                intensity profiles of the CGM, shown below.

            <h3>Synthetic Spectra</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <p>
                edit this --> I utilized novel synthetic spectroscopy techniques
                to determine column densities and velocity distributions of
                various ions within the Patient0 galaxy simulation and a second
                Patient0 iteration with CR physics implemented. Extracting this
                data using Python-based, observer-developed Voigt profile
                fitting tools (linetools, pyigm, veeper), I was able to directly
                compare spectral line properties in our simulation to
                observations in the COS-Halos survey—these contributions to the
                project resulted in my co-authorship on the publication.
                Ultimately, we found the im- plementation of CR physics produced
                simulated O vi and Si iii absorption feature widths in better
                agreement with observations.

                I am interested in researching how to use simulations to better
                understand the circumgalactic medium and the processes that
                drive the galactic baryon cycle. I received my B.S. in Astronomy
                and Physics, with a minor in Applied Mathematics from the
                University of Washington in 2022. Currently, I am a graduate
                student at Rutgers University studying synthetic observations
                with Professor Alyson Brooks. My long term goals are to become
                an astronomy professor researching extragalactic astronomy and
                prioritizing inclusive STEM education.

                Outside of research, I am passionate about Diversity, Equity,
                and Inclusion (D.E.I) efforts. At the University of Washington
                (UW), I volunteered as an
                <a
                  href="https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/urls/#:~:text=Undergraduate%20Research%20Leaders%20(URLs)%20are,their%20experiences%20with%20other%20undergraduates."

                  >Undergraduate Research Leader</a
                >
                and worked to motivate my peers across disciplines to
                participate in research, along with helping facilitate the UW
                Undergraduate Research Symposium. I also lead the Physical
                Sciences Curriculum team within
                <a href="https://synbioforeveryone.org/Home" target="_blank"
                  >Synbio for Everyone</a
                >—a UW-student organization aiming to improve accessibility and
                reduce equity gaps in STEM education. Moving forward, I hope to
                incorporate D.E.I work in each stage of my academic journey.
